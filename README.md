# AutoCorrect-using-python
In this project you will get to see how to autocorrect words using Python
Ok now let’s say we type a word in the keyboard of our smartphone. If the word exists in the vocabulary of our smartphone then it will assume that we have written the right word. It doesn’t matter whether we write a name, a noun or anything.
If the word exists in the history of the smartphone, it will generalize the word as a correct word. But what if the word doesn’t exist? If the word that we have typed is a non-existing word in the history of our smartphone then the autocorrect is programmed in such a way that it finds the most similar words from the history of our smartphone.
